/**
 * Runs once a day in the background and writes one local JSON snapshot of
 * everything (customers, debts, materials, prices, catalog) to the app's
 * own private storage — see [BackupManager]. Deliberately silent end to
 * end: this worker never posts a notification, on success or failure. If
 * it fails (no network yet, nothing synced at all so far, etc.) it just
 * retries on WorkManager's own backoff and tries again on the next
 * scheduled run; nothing is ever shown to the person either way.
 *
 * Scheduled with KEEP (not UPDATE, unlike BackgroundSyncWorker): a daily
 * backup's exact anchor time doesn't matter, so re-launching the app
 * should never reset an already-running schedule — only the very first
 * launch after install actually enqueues it.

/**
 * Runs a single silent backup right after the person actually changes
 * something (added/edited a customer, a debt, a material, a price, a
 * catalog entry). Previously the only backup was [DailyBackupWorker],
 * which meant up to 24 hours of new debts/materials existed nowhere but
 * the live Firestore data — if that ever needed restoring from a local
 * snapshot, everything added "today" was gone. This makes every change
 * durable within seconds instead of waiting for the next scheduled day.
 *
 * Still completely silent (no notification, ever) and still local-only
 * (writes to the same `filesDir/backups` directory as the daily worker —
 * see [BackupManager]), so nothing about the "never surfaced to the
 * person" contract changes, only how often it runs.
 *
 * Implemented as WorkManager (not a raw coroutine launched straight from
 * a ViewModel) so it: (a) still finishes even if the screen is closed or
 * the ViewModel is cleared right after the add, and (b) is safe to call
 * on every single add/edit without spamming disk writes — [requestNow]
 * enqueues with `REPLACE` on a short delay, so five rapid-fire adds in a
 * row collapse into exactly one backup a moment after the last one,
 * instead of five redundant ones.
