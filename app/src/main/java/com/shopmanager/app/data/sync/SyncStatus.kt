/**
 * "طبقة مساعدة للمزامنة" (sync helper layer): before this, the only signal
 * anyone had about sync health was [hasSyncError] on DebtsViewModel /
 * MaterialsViewModel — which only flips on *after* a live Firestore
 * listener has already failed. There was nothing that told the person
 * *why* (no internet vs. a real server problem) or *when* things last
 * synced successfully. This file is the small, self-contained layer other
 * screens can build on instead of each reinventing connectivity checks:
 *
 * - [SyncConnectivityObserver] — a live "متصل / غير متصل" signal, independent
 *   of Firestore ever actually trying to talk to the network.
 * - [SyncStatusStore] — remembers the last time *any* repository listener
 *   (debts or materials) received real data, on this device, across app
 *   restarts.
 *
 * Both are read by the new "المزامنة" section in Settings; [SyncStatusStore]
 * is also written to from DebtsViewModel/MaterialsViewModel's existing
 * listener `onEach` (see the BUG FIXED note there for why it already reset
 * `hasSyncError` on every real update — recording the timestamp piggybacks
 * on that exact same, already-correct signal instead of adding a new one).

     * the first change, so a UI collecting this never shows a stale
     * "جاري التحقق" before the first real callback fires.
