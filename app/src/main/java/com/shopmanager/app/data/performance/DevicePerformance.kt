/**
 * "وضع لكل هاتف": instead of one fixed UI for every device, the app decides
 * once — the very first time it runs on a phone — whether that phone is
 * entry-level or not, and remembers the answer locally (no server call, no
 * network, no per-model whitelist to maintain).
 *
 * There is no reliable public API for "which phone model is this" mapped to
 * "how fast is it", and hardcoding a list of model names (redmi a10,
 * sm-a165 for the Samsung A16, ...) would break the moment a new budget
 * phone ships. So instead of guessing from the model string, this reads the
 * two signals Android actually exposes that correlate with real-world
 * jank on low-end hardware:
 *
 * - total RAM (via ActivityManager.MemoryInfo) — a Redmi A10 ships with
 *   2–3GB, a Samsung A16 with 4–6GB.
 * - CPU core count (Runtime.availableProcessors()) — budget SoCs are
 *   commonly quad-core, mid-range and up are usually 8-core.
 * - ActivityManager.isLowRamDevice() — Android's own "go edition / low
 *   RAM" flag, set by the OEM/OS itself for exactly this purpose.
 * - FEATURE ADDED ("اصلاحات للاجهزة اللي فيها معالج رسوميات ضعيف"): the
 *   three signals above are all about RAM/CPU — none of them actually
 *   look at the GPU, so a phone with decent RAM and core count but a
 *   genuinely weak/old GPU (common on budget MediaTek Helio-series chips,
 *   which often pair 4GB+ RAM with a low-end Mali GPU) still landed on
 *   STANDARD and got the full gradients/glow/blur-adjacent effects it
 *   can't actually push at 60fps. ActivityManager's own
 *   `getDeviceConfigurationInfo().reqGlEsVersion` — the OpenGL ES version
 *   the device's GPU driver reports supporting — is a standard, free
 *   (no GL context needed) proxy for GPU generation: anything below ES
 *   3.0 is old/entry-level hardware by now. Reported the same way as the
 *   others below (as `glEsVersion`, and folded into `tier` alongside RAM/
 *   cores), so a weak GPU alone is now enough to land a device on LOW even
 *   when its RAM and core count look fine.
 * - IMPROVEMENT ADDED (دقة أعلى للكشف): `ActivityManager.getMemoryClass()`
 *   — the per-app heap ceiling in MB the OS itself hands this process — is
 *   folded in as its own independent trigger too. It is not just "RAM
 *   again": OEMs tune this value per device based on their own internal
 *   tiering (RAM, expected workload, sometimes region/SKU), so it catches
 *   OEM-flagged budget units whose raw RAM number alone reads as
 *   borderline-fine (e.g. 4GB with a heap capped at 128MB, versus a
 *   "real" 4GB device with a 192MB+ heap). Free to read (no allocation),
 *   same call already made once via `activityManager` above.
 * - IMPROVEMENT ADDED (إبطال التخزين المؤقت تلقائيًا عند تحسين المنطق):
 *   the cached tier used to persist forever once written, so a phone that
 *   was misclassified before a later logic improvement (like the GPU or
 *   heap-class checks above) stayed on the old, wrong classification until
 *   someone opened Settings and tapped "إعادة فحص" — or reinstalled.
 *   [detectTier] now stores a `DETECTION_VERSION` alongside the cached
 *   tier and ignores (re-measures) any cache written under an older
 *   version, so every detection-logic upgrade in this file self-heals on
 *   the very next app launch, for every device, with no manual action.
 *
 * Any one of these tripping is enough to land a device on LOW — false
 * positives (an OK phone getting the lighter UI) just mean slightly fewer
 * animations, which is a much cheaper mistake than false negatives (a weak
 * phone getting the full-effects UI and lagging).
